## The "Fear of Missing Out"
Apex Legends™ is a masterpiece of fast-paced, tactical battle royale. It's beautiful. It's demanding. But try running it on anything pre-2020. Your frame rates will plummet. Your reactions will lag. You'll lose fights, blame lag, and silently despair as your squad wonders why you're always last alive. The Source Engine pushes more than you think.

Your old rig is a bottleneck. It's costing you wins. It's killing your K/D. The FOMO is real: other players are enjoying smooth 144+ FPS. They see you before you see them. But don't panic. SpecMatch.io has dug deep. We've analyzed the hardware. Here's exactly what you need to dominate. No excuses.
