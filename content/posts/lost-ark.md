## The "Fear of Missing Out"
Lost Ark is a spectacle. Explosions, particle effects, hundreds of players on screen. Its beauty is undeniable. Its demands are real. This isn't some retro indie title. This is a sprawling, fast-paced MMO-ARPG built to push systems.

Your aging rig? That pre-2020 machine? It's not just struggling; it's choking. Stutters in chaos gates. Frame drops in Legion Raids. You're missing critical mechanics because your hardware can't keep up. The FOMO is justified. You need raw power to experience Lost Ark as intended. We cut through the noise. SpecMatch.io has analyzed the requirements. We found your perfect hardware match.

## Why You Need This Power
*   **Particle Effect Overload:** Lost Ark is an absolute fireworks display. Every class ability, every boss attack generates intense visual effects. These hammer your GPU.
*   **Massive Player Density:** Cities, world bosses, Legion Raids. Hundreds of player characters, their gear, their skills rendered simultaneously. Your CPU and GPU both take a beating.
*   **Action-Packed Combat:** High refresh rates are not a luxury here. They are a necessity for reacting to boss patterns and dodging attacks. Low FPS means missed mechanics.
