## Hardware Analysis

Helldivers 2 can be surprisingly CPU-intensive, especially during chaotic firefights with numerous enemies and explosive particle effects. The recommended Intel Core i7-9700K or AMD Ryzen 7 3700X are strong 8-core desktop processors. For a laptop, this translates to needing a modern multi-core CPU, such as an Intel Core i7 (11th Gen or newer H-series) or AMD Ryzen 7 (5000 series H/HS or newer), to ensure smooth gameplay and prevent bottlenecks during intense missions.

Visually, Helldivers 2 features detailed environments, dynamic lighting, and a plethora of particle effects that truly shine during large-scale battles. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600XT desktop GPUs are recommended for a solid 1080p experience, possibly even 1440p with adjusted settings. To achieve similar performance in a laptop, you'll generally need at least an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or RTX 4060 (laptop variants) to render the game's chaos without significant frame drops, especially when the action heats up.

Considering the strong CPU and GPU recommendations, alongside the 16GB RAM and SSD requirement, running Helldivers 2 optimally on a laptop will require a **Mid-range gaming laptop**.

## Our Recommendation

Based on these benchmarks, you need a laptop equipped with at least a **Laptop RTX 2060 16GB RAM**.
