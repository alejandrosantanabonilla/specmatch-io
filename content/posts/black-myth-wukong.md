## Hardware Analysis

Black Myth: Wukong demands a robust processor, with the recommended Intel Core i7-9700 or AMD Ryzen 5 5500 indicating the need for a modern, multi-core CPU. For laptops, this translates to at least an Intel Core i5 (11th generation H-series or newer) or an AMD Ryzen 5 (5000 series H-series or newer) to ensure smooth gameplay, handle complex AI, physics, and background processes without bottlenecking the system. While these are desktop parts, their performance tier signifies that mid-range laptop CPUs are generally sufficient, though a higher core count and clock speed will always provide a better experience, especially in CPU-intensive sections.

Graphically, the game is set to push boundaries, recommending an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060, AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT, or Intel Arc A750. Running on Unreal Engine 5, expect highly detailed textures, advanced lighting (likely leveraging Lumen), and complex particle effects that demand significant GPU horsepower to render at playable frame rates. The crucial note that these specifications were tested with DLSS/FSR/XeSS enabled highlights the importance of modern upscaling technologies to achieve optimal performance, especially on these mid-tier GPUs. For laptops, this points towards an RTX 3050 Ti (with upscaling assistance), an RTX 3060, or an AMD Radeon RX 6600M/6700M as suitable mobile equivalents to manage the visual fidelity.

To meet Black Myth: Wukong's recommended specifications and enjoy the game as intended, you'll be looking at a **Mid-range** gaming laptop.

## Our Recommendation

Based on these benchmarks, you need a laptop equipped with at least a **Laptop RTX 2060 16GB RAM**.
