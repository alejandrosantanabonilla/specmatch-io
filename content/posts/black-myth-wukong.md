## The "Fear of Missing Out"
Black Myth: Wukong is coming. It's visually stunning. It’s the next-gen action RPG you’ve been waiting for, a masterpiece of art and combat. But here’s the cold truth: your old rig? It won’t keep up.

Unreal Engine 5 doesn't play nice with ancient hardware. If your PC predates 2020, you're looking at a slideshow, not an epic journey. You will miss the fluid combat, the incredible details, the immersion. The FOMO is real. SpecMatch has analyzed the requirements. We know the exact hardware match.

## The "SpecMatch" Quick Reference
| Target Experience | The SpecMatch GPU | The SpecMatch CPU | Est. Budget |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **1080p (Entry)** | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 | Intel Core i5-13400F | ~$900 |
| **1440p (Sweet Spot)** | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Super | Ryzen 7 7800X3D | ~$1,500 |
| **4K Ultra (Elite)** | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 | Intel Core i9-14900K | ~$2,800+ |

## Why You Need This Power
* **Unreal Engine 5 Demands:** This game leverages Nanite virtualized geometry and Lumen global illumination. Every frame is rendered with insane detail. Not cheap.
* **Next-Gen Fidelity:** Intricate character models, advanced particle effects, and high-resolution environmental textures. These are hardware intensive. You need raw power.
* **Intense Combat:** Fast-paced, physics-heavy encounters. Stutter means death. Smooth framerates are non-negotiable for competitive play and immersion.

## The Verdict: The Hardware Standard
If you want to play Black Myth: Wukong without lag, without compromise, this is the floor. We have selected the specific components that tame Unreal Engine 5.

### 1. The Visual Powerhouse (1440p Ultra)

* **GPU:** [ASUS Dual GeForce RTX 4070 Super](https://amzn.to/4b8FWqh)
  * *The UE5 Tamer:* Wukong is heavy on lighting and textures. The "Super" edition gives you the extra muscle and DLSS 3.5 needed to run Lumen lighting at high framerates without breaking a sweat.
  * [**>> Check Price on Amazon <<**](https://amzn.to/4b8FWqh)

* **CPU:** [AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D](https://amzn.to/3N1ITyW)
  * *The FPS King:* This is currently the best gaming CPU on the planet. Its massive 3D V-Cache eliminates the "stuttering" issues common in open-world Unreal Engine games.

### 2. The Hidden Bottleneck (Storage)

* **SSD:** [Samsung 990 PRO 2TB NVMe](https://amzn.to/48UjFLz)
  * *Zero Load Times:* Unreal Engine 5 streams billions of polygons directly from your drive. A slow SSD causes textures to pop in late. The 990 PRO is the fastest fix for a seamless experience.

### 3. The Control

* **Gamepad:** [8BitDo Ultimate Controller with Dock](https://amzn.to/4sjnL7K)
  * *Precision Combat:* In a Soulslike, one missed dodge means death. This controller uses "Hall Effect" joysticks that never drift or wear out, giving you pixel-perfect accuracy forever.
