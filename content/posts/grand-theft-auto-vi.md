Here’s the cold, hard truth: your pre-2020 rig will choke. Stuttering. Low frames. Missing crucial details. This isn't just about playing the game; it's about *experiencing* it. Don't let your hardware be the bottleneck between you and Vice City. SpecMatch has done the deep dive. We’ve crunched the numbers to ensure you hit that glorious 60 FPS minimum. No compromises.
