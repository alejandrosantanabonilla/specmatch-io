## The "Fear of Missing Out"
ELDEN RING. A masterpiece. A world of unfathomable scale and beauty. But that beauty comes at a price: raw hardware power. You don't want to conquer the Lands Between only to be conquered by crippling frame drops. You don't want to miss a crucial dodge roll because your rig choked.

If your PC is pre-2020, expect pain. FromSoftware's demanding engine, while visually stunning, punishes anything less than modern silicon. Stutters, low textures, and constant loading hitches will shatter your immersion. Don't be the Tarnished stuck at 30 FPS. SpecMatch has done the brutal analysis. We'll tell you exactly what you need to obliterate lag and experience the game as intended: flawlessly.
