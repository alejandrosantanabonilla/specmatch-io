## The "Fear of Missing Out"
**Resident Evil Requiem** represents the pinnacle of Capcom's technical ambition, utilizing a heavily upgraded RE Engine to deliver terrifyingly realistic environments. With support for Path Tracing and NVIDIA DLSS 4, the game aims to be the most visually stunning entry in the franchise to date—but that beauty comes at a massive cost to your hardware.

Older rigs are officially on notice. If your system was built before 2020, the advanced lighting technologies and real-time ray tracing will likely turn your gameplay into a slideshow. SpecMatch has dissected the official specs released by Capcom to find your ideal hardware match so you can face the horror without the stutter.

## The "SpecMatch" Quick Reference
| Target Experience | The SpecMatch GPU (Laptop) | The SpecMatch CPU | Est. Budget |
|-------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **1080p (Entry)** | **RTX 4050 (6GB)** | Core i5-13420H | ~$900 |
| **1440p (Sweet Spot)** | **RTX 4070 (8GB)** | Ryzen 7 8845HS | ~$1,400 |
| **4K Ultra (Elite)** | **RTX 4090 (16GB)** | Core i9-14900HX | ~$2,800+ |

## Why You Need This Power
* **Path Tracing & DLSS 4 Support:** The game is built for cutting-edge NVIDIA features that require modern tensor cores to run smoothly at high resolutions.
* **High VRAM for Horror Detail:** The "Recommended" specs call for 8GB of dedicated VRAM just to handle the enhanced texture detail at 1080p.
* **CPU-Intensive AI:** Resident Evil Requiem's eerie world is brought to life with complex AI systems that tax older mid-tier processors.

## The Verdict: Buy This Laptop
If you want to play **Resident Evil Requiem** without lag, an **RTX 4060 (8GB)** laptop is the absolute floor. It provides the 8GB of VRAM and DirectX 12 support required to handle the game's ambitious lighting without crashing.
