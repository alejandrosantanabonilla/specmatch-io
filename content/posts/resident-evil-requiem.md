## The "Fear of Missing Out"
**Resident Evil Requiem** is the first title in the series to officially support **Full Path Tracing** and **DLSS 4.5** on PC. While the RE Engine is famously optimized, this new entry pushes volumetric lighting and asset density to a level that will make older hardware scream.

If you're still on a rig from 2019 or earlier, you aren't just missing out on frames—you're missing the atmosphere. Path-traced shadows and real-time reflections are what make the ruins of Raccoon City truly terrifying. SpecMatch has analyzed the official Capcom benchmarks to find the hardware that keeps you in the game and out of the "Game Over" screen.

## Official System Requirements (Updated 2026)
| Component | Minimum (1080p/30) | Recommended (1080p/60) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CPU** | Intel i5-8500 / Ryzen 5 3500 | Intel i7-8700 / Ryzen 5 5500 |
| **GPU** | GTX 1660 (6GB) | RTX 2060 Super (8GB) |
| **RAM** | 16 GB | 16 GB (32GB for Path Tracing) |
| **OS** | Windows 11 (64-bit) | Windows 11 (64-bit) |

## SpecMatch Custom Selection: Horror-Ready Laptops
Survival horror requires two things: **Deep Blacks (OLED)** and **Consistent Frame Times**. Here are our top three picks for *Requiem*.

### 1. The Value Survivor (1080p Ultra)
**Lenovo LOQ 15 (Gen 10)**
* **Specs:** NVIDIA RTX 5050 (Next-Gen Architecture), Intel Core i7-14650HX, 144Hz IPS
* **Why:** The new **RTX 5050** supports **DLSS 4**, which is critical for maintaining 60 FPS in *Requiem* without breaking the bank. It is the most affordable gateway to 2026's survival horror titles.

### 2. The Atmospheric King (1440p Path Tracing)
**Lenovo Legion Pro 7i (Gen 10)**
* **Specs:** RTX 5070 Ti, Core Ultra 9 275HX, **16-inch OLED HDR 1000 True Black**
* **Why:** Horror is defined by its shadows. The **True Black 1000 OLED** screen on this Legion makes the dark corridors of *Requiem* genuinely pitch black, not "digital gray". It’s the sweet spot for path-traced visuals at 1440p.

## Why You Need This Power
* **Path Tracing:** Real-time light bounces mean every flashlight beam and candle flame reacts realistically with the environment.
* **DLSS 4.5 Support:** The latest AI upscaling is required to maintain 60 FPS when these advanced lighting features are enabled.
* **RE Engine Asset Streaming:** High-speed NVMe SSDs are required to avoid "hiccups" when moving between large outdoor areas and tight indoor spaces.

## The Verdict: Buy This Laptop
If you want to play **Resident Evil Requiem** without lag, an **RTX 4060 (8GB)** laptop is the absolute floor. It provides the 8GB of VRAM and DirectX 12 support required to handle the game's ambitious lighting without crashing.
