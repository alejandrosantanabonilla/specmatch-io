2. The 1440p "Sweet Spot" (Best Value)

    Desktop: CyberPowerPC Gamer Master (Ryzen 7 7700, RTX 4070 Super, 32GB RAM).

    Laptop: Lenovo Legion Pro 5i (Core i7-14700HX, RTX 4070).

    Why: Arknights: Endfield features sprawling environments; the RTX 4070 series allows you to push draw distance and lighting to the limit at 2K resolution.

3. The 4K Ultra Enthusiast (No Compromises)

    Desktop: Alienware Aurora R16 (Core i9-14900KF, RTX 4080 Super, 32GB DDR5).

    Laptop: Razer Blade 16 (Core i9, RTX 4090, Mini-LED Display).

    Why: To run a natively 3D anime-style game in 4K with maximum post-processing, you need the massive VRAM overhead provided by these high-end cards.
