Are you looking to play **Apex Legends™** but don't know if your laptop can handle it? We've analyzed the official system requirements to help you find the perfect machine.

## Official Specs Reference

To run Apex Legends™ smoothly, the developers recommend:

> **Recommended Specs:**
> Recommended:

## Hardware Analysis

The recommended Ryzen 5 CPU suggests a need for a modern mid-range processor capable of handling game logic and background tasks efficiently. For laptops, this translates to an Intel Core i5 (10th Gen or newer H/HS series) or an AMD Ryzen 5 (4000 series or newer H/HS series) with at least 4 cores/8 threads. While Apex isn't the most CPU-intensive title, a stronger processor ensures stable frame rates, especially in chaotic team fights, and prevents bottlenecks with a capable GPU.

The official recommendation for an AMD Radeon R9 290 or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 points to a capable 1080p gaming experience. These desktop cards, while older, were solid performers for their time, demanding a laptop equivalent that can render Apex Legends' dynamic environments, detailed character models, and fast-paced particle effects at competitive frame rates. Look for modern laptop GPUs like the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650/1660 Ti, or newer RTX 3050/4050 (or AMD Radeon RX 6600M equivalents) to consistently hit 60+ FPS at 1080p with medium-to-high settings, crucial for a fluid and responsive shooter experience.

Considering the need for a competent multi-core CPU and a dedicated GPU equivalent to or exceeding a GTX 970, a **Mid-range gaming laptop** will provide an excellent and consistent Apex Legends experience, especially if you're aiming for higher refresh rates and visual fidelity.

## Our Recommendation

Based on these benchmarks, you need a laptop equipped with at least a **Laptop Gaming 8GB RAM**.
