Are you looking to play **Monster Hunter Wilds** but don't know if your laptop can handle it? We've analyzed the official system requirements to help you find the perfect machine.

## Official Specs Reference

To run Monster Hunter Wilds smoothly, the developers recommend:

> **Recommended Specs:**
> Recommended: 
 Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system 
 OS:  Windows®10 (64-bit Required)/Windows®11 (64-bit Required) 
 Processor:  Intel® Core™ i5-10400 or Intel® Core™ i3-12100 or AMD Ryzen™ 5 3600 
 Memory:  16 GB RAM 
 Graphics:  NVIDIA® GeForce® RTX 2060 Super(VRAM 8GB) or　AMD Radeon™  RX 6600(VRAM 8GB) 
 DirectX:  Version 12 
 Network:  Broadband Internet connection 
 Storage:  75 GB available space 
 Additional Notes:  SSD required. This game is expected to run at 1080p / 60 fps (with Frame Generation enabled) under the "Medium" graphics setting. DirectStorage supported.

## Hardware Analysis

Monster Hunter Wilds demands a robust CPU to handle its vast, dynamic world and complex game mechanics. The recommended Intel Core i5-10400 or AMD Ryzen 5 3600 suggests the need for capable multi-core performance, ideally with at least 6 cores and 12 threads. However, the inclusion of the Intel Core i3-12100 highlights that strong single-core performance from newer architectures is also highly beneficial. For laptops, this translates to an Intel Core i5 or i7 (11th generation or newer) or an AMD Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7 (5000 series or newer) to ensure smooth gameplay and efficient resource management.

Graphically, the game sets its sights on GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 2060 Super or AMD RX 6600, both critically featuring 8GB of VRAM. This substantial VRAM is essential for rendering the game's high-resolution monster and environment textures, intricate lighting, and particle effects across its expansive maps at 1080p. The target of 60 fps on "Medium" settings *with Frame Generation enabled* indicates that the game is graphically intensive, and without Frame Generation, native performance might require lower settings or a more powerful GPU. Support for DirectX 12 and DirectStorage further benefits from a modern GPU and SSD for accelerated asset loading and overall fidelity.

To comfortably meet these recommended specifications and enjoy Monster Hunter Wilds, you'll generally be looking at a **mid-range** gaming laptop.

## Our Recommendation

Based on these benchmarks, you need a laptop equipped with at least a **Laptop RTX 2060 16GB RAM**.
