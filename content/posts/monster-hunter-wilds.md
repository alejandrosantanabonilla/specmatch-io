## The "Fear of Missing Out" is Real
Monster Hunter Wilds is coming on **February 28, 2025**. It looks stunning. Vast, seamless open worlds. Unprecedented monster detail. Dynamic weather. The **RE ENGINE** is being pushed to its limits. This isn't just another game. This is a generational leap.

Your old rig? Anything pre-2020—and even some mid-range laptops from 2022—will struggle. Dropped frames. Muddy textures. You don't want to miss the true Wilds experience because your hardware can't keep up.

SpecMatch has done the brutal analysis. We pinpoint the exact hardware match you need. Zero compromises.

## Official System Requirements (Desktop)
Before we look at laptops, look at what Capcom demands for desktops. Note the **Frame Gen** requirement.

| Setting | 1080p (Medium) | 4K (Ultra) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FPS Target** | 60 FPS (w/ Frame Gen) | 60 FPS (w/ Frame Gen) |
| **CPU** | i5-10400 / Ryzen 3600 | i5-12400 / Ryzen 7 5800X |
| **GPU** | RTX 2070 Super / RX 6700 XT | RTX 4070 Ti Super |
| **RAM** | 16 GB | 16 GB |

> **Warning:** The "Recommended" specs listed by Capcom assume you are using DLSS 3 or FSR 3 Frame Generation. If you have an older card (like a GTX 1080), you will struggle to hit 60 FPS.
