## Hardware Analysis

War Thunder, while not the most graphically demanding title on the market, still benefits significantly from balanced hardware to deliver its best experience, especially across its diverse environments and vehicle types.

For the CPU, the recommended Intel Core i5 or Ryzen 5 3600 points towards a modern quad-core or hexa-core processor. On a laptop, this translates to an Intel Core i5-11th generation or newer (e.g., i5-12500H, i5-13400H) or an AMD Ryzen 5-5000 series or newer (e.g., Ryzen 5 5600H, Ryzen 5 7640HS). These CPUs provide ample processing power for managing game logic, physics calculations, AI for bots, and supporting the large-scale multiplayer battles without creating a bottleneck, ensuring smooth gameplay even when the action gets intense.

The graphical demands are met by a DirectX 11/12 level video card like the Nvidia GeForce 1060 or Radeon RX 570. In the laptop space, this means you'll need a dedicated GPU equivalent to or better than these. War Thunder utilizes detailed textures for its realistic vehicle models, intricate environmental lighting, and impressive particle effects for explosions and weather. To enjoy these elements at high settings and smooth frame rates (60+ FPS) at 1080p, aim for modern laptop GPUs such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050, RTX 4050, or AMD Radeon RX 6600M/7600S. These cards offer sufficient VRAM and performance to render the vast battlefields and intense combat with high fidelity.

Considering the need for a dedicated, mid-range GPU, a capable multi-core CPU, and 16GB of RAM, an optimal War Thunder experience on a laptop will require a **Mid-range** gaming laptop.

## Our Recommendation

Based on these benchmarks, you need a laptop equipped with at least a **Laptop Gaming 16GB RAM**.
