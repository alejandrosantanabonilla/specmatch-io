Are you looking to play **Counter-Strike 2** but don't know if your laptop can handle it? We've analyzed the official system requirements to help you find the perfect machine.

## Official Specs Reference

To run Counter-Strike 2 smoothly, the developers recommend:

> **Recommended Specs:**
> Minimum: 
 OS:  Windows® 10 
 Processor:  4 hardware CPU threads - Intel® Core™ i5 750 or higher 
 Memory:  8 GB RAM 
 Graphics:  Video card must be 1 GB or more and should be a DirectX 11-compatible with support for Shader Model 5.0 
 DirectX:  Version 11 
 Storage:  85 GB available space

## Hardware Analysis

For Counter-Strike 2, the official CPU requirements, listing an Intel Core i5-750 or higher, point to the need for a quad-core processor with decent single-thread performance. While the i5-750 is an extremely dated CPU from 2009, its "4 hardware CPU threads" specification indicates that modern laptop processors, even lower-tier options like an Intel Core i3 (10th gen or newer) or an AMD Ryzen 3 (3000 series or newer), will easily meet and exceed this baseline. However, for consistent high frame rates crucial for competitive play (144 FPS+), a modern mid-range CPU like an Intel Core i5 (11th gen+) or AMD Ryzen 5 (5000 series+) is highly recommended to prevent bottlenecks, especially during intense firefights or on specific maps.

Graphically, Counter-Strike 2, powered by the Source 2 engine, presents a significant visual upgrade over its predecessor. While the minimum spec calls for a DirectX 11-compatible card with 1GB VRAM and Shader Model 5.0, this is merely for launching the game. The updated textures, more realistic lighting, dynamic and volumetric smoke effects, and enhanced environmental details demand more from the GPU for a smooth experience. For competitive gameplay where consistent high frame rates (144Hz or more) are paramount to reduce input lag and provide a fluid visual experience, a dedicated GPU like an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 or an AMD Radeon RX 6400M/6500M is a practical minimum. These GPUs ensure stable performance even during particle-heavy effects and offer the visual clarity needed to spot opponents effectively.

To reliably achieve a competitive frame rate of 144 FPS or higher at FHD resolution with medium to high settings in Counter-Strike 2, you'll generally be looking at a **mid-range gaming laptop**.

## Our Recommendation

Based on these benchmarks, you need a laptop equipped with at least a **Laptop Gaming 8GB RAM**.
