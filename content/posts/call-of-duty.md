## Hardware Analysis

When diving into Call of Duty's intense firefights on a laptop, understanding the underlying hardware requirements is key to a smooth experience.

The recommended CPUs, such as the AMD Ryzen 5 1600X or Intel Core i7-6700K, signify that Call of Duty leverages multiple CPU cores for its demanding engine. These processors, while a few generations old, still offer ample multi-threaded performance for handling game logic, AI, and physics without becoming a bottleneck. For a modern laptop, you'd be looking for a processor equivalent to an Intel Core i5-11400H/12500H or an AMD Ryzen 5 5600H/6600H or newer, ensuring a stable frame rate even during heavy action sequences.

Graphically, the game sets a high bar with recommendations like the AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060. These desktop GPUs are formidable for 1080p high refresh rate gaming and can even push into 1440p territory. In a laptop context, this translates to a mobile NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060, RTX 4050/4060, or an AMD Radeon RX 6600M/6700S. This level of GPU power is essential to render Call of Duty's highly detailed environments, realistic weapon models, intricate particle effects, and advanced lighting/shadows at playable frame rates, especially with high-resolution textures enabled. Adequate VRAM, ideally 6GB or more, is critical to prevent performance hitches.

To comfortably meet Call of Duty's recommended specifications and truly enjoy the game's visuals and performance, you will typically need to invest in a **Mid-range** to **High-end** gaming laptop.

## Our Recommendation

Based on these benchmarks, you need a laptop equipped with at least a **Laptop RX 6600 12GB RAM**.
